    Welcome to Sonic Comics Wiki, aka SoniComix! This wiki is a side project in [[artist:quasar-nebula|QN's]] spare time - it's mostly a for-fun experiment to see how readily the codebase of the [Homestuck Music Wiki](https://hsmusic.wiki/) can be adapted to a rather different kind of content. But we also wanted a fun way to explore the many issues of IDW Sonic and their contributors - hopefully you'll find this place a neat or handy reference, too!

    The background art for this wiki is Issue 68's Cover A, illustrated by [[artist:min-ho-kim]].
