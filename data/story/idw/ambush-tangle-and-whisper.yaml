Story Summary: |-
    As they consider their approach into the forgotten Eggman bunker (where [[Mimic]] is waiting for them), [[Tangle]] brings up, to [[Whisper]], that Mimic "seemed to think you were something called a 'Diamond Cutter.'" Whisper considers but offers only a subdued "yes," and Tangle lets this touchy subject go.

    As the two walk in, Mimic, watching from above, muses that Whisper "couldn't do much outside of the old gang" â€” always her weakness. He alludes that [[Whisper's Wisps|her wisps]] (for her now, admittedly, "a very effective crutch") used to belong to this old gang.

    After some explosive combat one-on-one with Whisper, Mimic shifts out of his Tangle disguise and into each of the other old Diamond Cutters: [[Slinger the Ocelot]], [[Claire Voyance]], and [[Smithy the Lion]], in turn. He plays the blaming game: "They were <em>my</em> friends just as much as <em>yours.</em> And you <em>failed</em> to protect them." The disguises set Whisper back as much as Mimic's words, but eventually, Whisper swings at Smithy's form and tells Mimic <em>"You</em> sold us out! I will make you <em>pay!</em> For <em>all of them!"</em>

    Blah blah.
