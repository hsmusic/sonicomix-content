    "Showdown!" This is it! Whisper's ready to confront her old foe, and Tangle's more than happy to back her up! Of course, if the bad guy knows he's walking into a trap, he's going to be prepared, right? Maybe this won't be so easy, since he's got a Badnik army backing him up! The final fantastic issue of the first Sonic the Hedgehog mini-series in almost two decades!
