    This is it. The few remaining fighters from the Restoration and their allies are ready to launch a final assault to reclaim the Chaos Emeralds and finally eliminate the Metal Virus. Can they defeat the Chaos Emeralds' new protectors, or will they all fall-and why isn't Sonic part of the fight?

    One last desperate attempt to save the world will take all the help Sonic can get-including from some former foes!

    With everyone exhausted as the world falls, will they be able to stand up to Chaos Emerald-powered bad guys and zombots?!
